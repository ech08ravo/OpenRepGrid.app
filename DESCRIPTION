Description: 
    Repertory grids are a qualitative-quantitative 
    data collection technique devised by George A. Kelly in the 1950s.
    Today, grids are used across a variety of disciplines from 
    clinical psychology to marketing. OpenRepGrid.app is a graphical 
    user interface (GUI) that allows analyzing and visualizing grid data.
    Under the hood, the GUI uses functions from the OpenRepGrid package 
    (<https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=OpenRepGrid>).
