	abstract = {A new hierarchical measure of cognitive complexity based on the repertory grid is described. This measure is considered to be both conceptually and empirically an advance over previous measures. It emphasizes that the structure of a subject's construct system is important, rather than merely its degree of differentiation. In this respect, it has advantages over previous measures based on the repertory grid. Three experiments are described which test the validity and reliability of the new measure. These experiments show that the hierarchical measure is reliable and is unrelated to a measure of differentiation based on the repertory grid. The hierarchical measure is shown to be positively related to performance on Harvey's ‘This I Believe’ test, which has been used as a projective measure of cognitive complexity. The hierarchical measure is also shown to be unrelated to performance on a verbal reasoning task.},

However, the techniques offered by psychology to help the teacher such as attitude scales, personality tests and questionnaires are less than satisfactory. The Kelly repertory grid is a new tool recently being used more extensively in education to raise the learner's awareness of the learning process, but many users have found the analysis of the grid difficult and unhelpful, and the structure too rigid.
This paper describes two BASIC computer programs to elicit and analyse grids easily and clearly. FOCUS uses a two-way cluster analytic method to re-order the constructs and the elements to highlight similarities and differences in the grid, and displays the focused results together with tree diagrams of the similarities in elements and constructs. PEGASUS is an interactive program which conversationally elicits a grid, processes and offers real-time feedback commentary on the results.},

	abstract = {Qualitative assessments of behaviour integrate and summarize the different aspects of an animal's dynamic style of interaction with the environment, using descriptors such as `timid' or `confident'. Although such qualitative terms are widely used in the study of animal temperament and personality, their use in relation to questions of animal welfare has yet to be formally explored. The terms used in integrative assessment (e.g., content, distressed) tend to have expressive, welfare-related connotations, and lie at the heart of the lay public's concern for animal suffering. For this reason they are frequently dismissed as `anthropomorphic' and unscientific. However, in theory it is possible that these terminologies reflect observable aspects of behavioural organization. They may therefore be liable to scientific analysis, and be of use as integrative welfare measurements. A first step in investigating this hypothesis is to examine the inter-observer reliability of assessments of behavioural expression. This study investigated the extent to which 18 naive observers showed agreement when given the opportunity to qualitatively describe, independently and in their own words, the behavioural expressions of 20 individual growing pigs. Pigs were brought singly into a test pen and given the opportunity to interact with a human squatting in the centre of the test pen. Observers were instructed to first observe each pig and then to write down terms which adequately summed up the emergent qualities of that pig's behaviour. Data thus consisted of 18 sets of individually generated descriptive terms, attributed to 20 pigs. This procedure was repeated a month later with the same observers but using a new group of 20 pigs. To analyze the resulting 36 sets of descriptive terms, pigs in each set were given a score for each term. This score was either 0 (term not used for that pig) or 1 (term used for that pig). These data were analyzed with Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA), a multivariate statistical technique which finds a consensus between observer assessment patterns (the `pig consensus profile'), and provides a measure of observer agreement. Results show that for each group of 20 pigs, the `pig consensus profile' differed significantly from an analysis of the same data in randomized form (p\&lt;0.001), indicating that the consensus profiles were not artifacts of the GPA procedures. It can therefore be concluded that observers showed significant agreement in their spontaneous assessment of pig expressions, which suggests that these assessments were based on commonly perceived and systematically applied criteria. The extent to which these shared criteria reflect observable aspects of behaviour now requires further study.},

In most grid applications implicit assumptions seem to be made that elements not chosen in grid sorts using one pole of a construct dimension will be chosen in sorts based on the other pole, and that relations between constructs derived from grid sorts using one pole of a construct will be the converse of the relations derived from sorts based on the other pole. The legitimacy of these assumptions was examined experimentally with the co-operation of ten male medical students acting as subjects. Considerable overlap in element choices based on opposite poles of five construct dimensions appeared for each subject, and the practical effects of this overlap on various types of grid scores were demonstrated. Suggestions for modifications in grid usage, and for further exploration of construct functions, are discussed.},

The cocoa content of the chocolate samples investigated in the study ranged from 60\% to 75\%, and General Procrustes Analysis and subsequent Principal Component Analysis were used for data analysis. Despite the different local background, both panels used an identical vocabulary for describing the samples; on average, only five descriptors (range: 3-13) were chosen by each assessor. Twenty nine different descriptors were generated by the Vienna panel, and 41 descriptors by the Dresden panel. Although differently assigned to Principal Components (PC) 1 and 2 which, together with PC3, accounted for approximately 85\% of the total variance, the panels distinguished between the samples on a comparable level and used a comparable terminology with respect to type and frequency of the descriptors. A combined data evaluation revealed that the easily perceivable taste descriptors were useful for sample separation, whereas flavor descriptors only supported these data. With respect to mouthfeel, chocolate with a lower cocoa content was characterized as melting and creamy, whereas the product with the highest cocoa content was characterized as dry, mealy and sticky.},

	abstract = {Fibromyalgia is a syndrome characterized by the presence of diffuse and chronic musculoskeletal pain of unknown etiology. Clinical diagnosis and the merely palliative treatments considerably affect the patient's experience and the chronic course of the disease. Therefore, several authors have emphasized the need to explore issues related to self in these patients. The repertory grid technique (RGT), derived from personal construct theory, is a method designed to assess the patient's construction of self and others. A group of women with fibromyalgia (n = 30) and a control group (n = 30) were assessed using RGT. Women with fibromyalgia also completed the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire and a visual-analogue scale for pain, and painful tender points were explored. Results suggest that these women had a higher present self–ideal self discrepancy and a lower perceived adequacy of others, and it was more likely to find implicative dilemmas among them compared to controls. These dilemmas are a type of cognitive conflict in which the symptom is construed as “enmeshed” with positive characteristics of the self. Finally, implications of these results for the psychological treatment of fibromyalgia are suggested to give a more central role to self-identity issues and to the related cognitive conflicts.},

In addition, necessary conditions suggested by Kristof and Wingersky are shown to be not sufficient. A rotation procedure that is an alternative to the one by Kristof and Wingersky is presented. Upper bounds are derived for determining the extent to which the procedure falls short of attaining the best least-squares fit. The problem of scaling matrices to maximal agreement is discussed.

However, most of the literature on crispness and crunchiness focuses on dry foods, and little work has been carried out on wet foods such as fruits and vegetables. The study presented here was designed to address two main issues: firstly, to gain a better understanding of consumer terminology relevant to the textural characteristics of fruits and vegetables, with particular emphasis on crispy and crunchy terms; secondly, to investigate the relationship between the vocabularies used by trained panels and consumers. Products were selected to give a wide range of textural characteristics. Free choice profiling was carried out with a small number of naı̈ve consumers, as well as with trained panellists. Both sets of data were analysed using generalised Procrustes analysis (GPA), which allowed comparison of the two sets of vocabularies generated. GPA maps showed that sensory perceptions expressed by a trained panel correlated well with consumer terminology. The study also reinforced the idea that crispness and crunchiness are complex concepts that combine a wide range of perceptions such as fracture characteristics, sound, density and geometry. Results showed a better agreement on the meaning and use of crunchy terms by consumers and panellists alike. On the other hand, crispness was less well understood, showing a much wider conceptual space.},

Constructive processes are largely tacit, but substance users are considered agents making choices, who ''know more than they can tell" despite reports of lack of control or understanding. An evolutionary constructivist perspective suggests that substance-centered selves (i.e., ''addictions") evolve in the course of a person's active efforts to construct meaning and adapt to construed social contexts.

The constructionist emphasis on microsocial processes also functions oppositionally to psychological accounting. The existing animus grows, however, from a realist metaphysics and a correspondence view of language, neither of which constructionism endorses. Viewing the relationship between constructionism and psychological science in more pragmatic terms, we find three significant ways in which constructionism contributes to a more fully enriched and broadly effective psychology. First, critical constructionism functions to denaturalize psychological accounts, opening them to reflexive deliberation, and democratizing the field more generally. Second, constructionist metatheory invites a resuscitation of marginal or suppressed discourse within the field, and invigorates societally engaged efforts to forge new and more useful discourses of the mind. Finally, social constructionism offers the possibility for a fundamental reconceptualization of the self. Illustrative is the family of theories conceptualizing the self as either constituted by or constituting relationships.},

These data lend support to the notion that part of the fascination, and the credibility, of brain imaging research lies in the persuasive power of the actual brain images themselves. We argue that brain images are influential because they provide a physical basis for abstract cognitive processes, appealing to people's affinity for reductionistic explanations of cognitive phenomena.},

The aim of this study was to identify attributes and associations that people use to describe different types of wood materials and to explore how they relate to preferences. The study involved nine samples that were evaluated with the Kelly's repertory grid technique and content analysis. Based on respondents' answers, 19 core categories reflecting sample attributes were extracted. General preferences for each sample were also recorded. Principal component analysis generated two factors describing 1) naturalness, wood-likeness, softness, unprocessed origin, living, pleasant, and high value; and 2) solid and homogeneous impression. A third, preliminary factor included categories describing irregular pattern, sleekness, and smoothness. The wood samples were most liked, whereas composites and panels were not appreciated. Preferred core categories were naturalness, wood-likeness, smoothness, living impression, and value. The least liked core categories were processed, hard, and high weight. The implications of the results for product development and marketing are discussed.},

The implication grid proved superior to the repertory grid under conditions designed to compare stability of matching scores and under conditions designed to compare sensitivity to subjects' changes in construing. The significance of a further result, that the implication grid was superior for reflecting construct bipolarity, is considered in the light of conceptual problems with an assumption of bipolarity. The set of results is especially noteworthy since ‘indirect’ measures were formerly the exclusive province of the repertory grid. The discussion raises general issues about the relative utility of two grid formats, and the unique measurement possibilities of the implication grid are illustrated. It is concluded that the’ implication grid deserves careful consideration for use in studies concerned only with construct relationships.},

	abstract = {A current popular theme in medicine concerns whether and how patients should be involved in treatment choice. Assuming patient involvement is desirable, how should one go about eliciting preferences? A variety of quantitative and qualitative methods exist that may be used for this purpose, one of which is the repertory grid method. This method involves eliciting constructs (reasons) for preferences through comparing sets of three options. This method allows the structured elicitation of the reasons behind individual preferences, but also, when used with generalised procrustes analysis (GPA), allows aggregation of individual data to reveal general preference patterns. In this study the repertory grid method was used to examine patient preferences for angina treatments with the goal of, first, gaining some understanding of general patterns of patient preference, and second, examining the likely utility of the technique in this setting. A sample of 21 patients with mild and stable angina from two general practices in Norfolk, UK was interviewed using the repertory grid method to elicit the constructs underlying their preferences amongst seven angina treatments (including ‘no treatment’). Individualised questionnaires were then produced and sent to the patients for self-completion, which required rating the extent to which each construct was relevant for each treatment (scored on visual analogue rating scales). Analysis of the ratings, using GPA, showed that the constructs clustered around two dimensions: ‘some treatment’ versus ‘no treatment’, and drug treatment versus surgical treatment. While some treatment was generally preferred to no treatment, individuals varied in preference for drug treatments or surgical treatments. Although the latter were generally perceived as ‘effective’ they were also perceived, for example, as ‘invasive’, ‘frightening’, related to ‘negative experiences’, and being more appropriate for when symptoms are severe (‘proportionate’). We consider the implications of these results for involving patients in choosing amongst treatments.},

The naïf panel results were analyzed by a three-way Tucker-1 common loadings model with predictive biplots, which proved to be a very good way to evaluate each assessor's perceptions and scoring patterns and to monitor the evolution of the overall panel's performance during training, including the validation of the list of attributes. The consumer panel results were also analyzed by predictive biplots applied to individual dimensions in generalized procrustes analysis (GPA), following data compression through principal components analysis. This technique, which can be extended to a detailed analysis of scoring patterns, enabled the checking of the main consumer's perceptions and beliefs, and simultaneously the evaluation of the interplay of constructs in the build up of consumers' main dimensions. Both panels were able to distinguish the main types of potato chips, as well as the different status of oil quality, producing similar overall solutions to the problem. However, it is observed that when working with consumer panels, due to the great variability involved, at least a reasonably trained sensory panel will help to validate the results obtained.

Generalized Procrustes Analysis showed that meat products were perceived in similar ways across the three age groups, with the middle-aged group sharing perceptions with the older group in particular. Subtle differences between age groups were observed: middle-aged and young consumers perceived white meats and fish as “healthy” and not red meats, which was in contrast to the older group who did describe red meats as “healthy”. Middle-aged and older consumers shared perceptions of lamb and pork chops, roasted chicken and comminuted or processed products; perceiving these more positively than the young group. Communication strategies aimed at influencing meat intakes of middle-aged consumers should be similar to those directed towards other age groups, however it may also be important to note these observed subtle age-related differences in perceptions.},

These works agree that organizational cognition is far too critical to be ignored as it can impact on IS outcomes. While cognition has been considered in a variety of IS contexts, no specific methodology has dominated. A theory and method suitable to the study of cognition-defined as personal constructs that individuals use to understand IT in organizations-is Kelly's (1955) personal construct theory and its cognitive mapping tool known as the repertory grid (RepGrid). This article expounds on the potential of this technique to IS researchers by considering the variety of ways the RepGrid may be employed. The flexibility of the RepGrid is illustrated by examining published studies in IS. The diagnostic qualities of the RepGrid and its mapping outcomes can be used for practical intervention at the individual and organizational levels.},

The main intent was to describe the evaluative component of the first factor (ECFF) and track changes in it across the 3 times 2 design. Hypotheses concerning the ECFF were that (a) the ECFF would increase under grid conditions involving figure comparison and a prerating construct valencing procedure and (b) the ECFF would increase across administration times. A secondary set of hypotheses related to the first factor as a measure of construct differentiation was as follows: (a) Differentiation would decrease under grid conditions involving figure comparison and a prerating construct valencing procedure, and (b) differentiation would decrease across administration times. A strong positive correlation among the three measures of differentiation was also hypothesized. Results supported hypothesized increases in the ECFF for different grid conditions, but, contrary to expectations, the ECFF remained stable across administration times. Differentiation scores, however, were found to increase both across grid conditions and administration times.},

Unsupervised learning, using seriation and matrix reordering, allows pattern discovery simultaneously at three information levels: local fragments of relationships, sets of organized local fragments of relationships, and an overall structural pattern. This paper presents an historical overview of seriation and matrix reordering methods, several applications from the following disciplines are included in the retrospective review: archaeology and anthropology; cartography, graphics, and information visualization; sociology and sociometry; psychology and psychometry; ecology; biology and bioinformatics; cellular manufacturing; and operations research.

The authors argue that one of the key determinants of this lack of validity is the multi-dimensionality of attribute importance. Building on the notable work of Myers and Alpert (1968) [Myers JH, Alpert MI. Determinant buying attitudes: Meaning and measurement. J Mark 1968;32(July):13–20], they propose that different methods measure different dimensions of attribute importance and, more specifically, what methods measure which specific dimensions. A re-examination of existing research reveals convergent and nomological validity among methods that are proposed to measure the same dimensions of attribute importance and discriminant validity between methods that are proposed to measure different dimensions of attribute importance. Acknowledging the multi-dimensionality of attribute importance substantially reduces the apparent lack of validity reported in the literature and forms an important first step enabling practitioners and scholars to improve the validity of attribute-importance measurement.},

Free-choice profiling is a technique that is used in sensory studies whereby assessors are allowed to describe products by using their own preferred descriptors and own number of descriptors. We show how a study of this type on eight varieties of port wine can be analysed and, in particular, how to associate the descriptors of the wines with each assessor and with a group average representation. We show how biplots combined with generalized orthogonal Procrustes analysis can be constructed and used to explore consistencies and idiosyncrasies among assessors’ uses of their descriptors and scales.},

The interpretation of the distance \${\textbackslash}Delta(P\_i, P\_j)\$ between the \$i\$th and \$j\$th members of the sample is discussed for some commonly used types of analysis, including both \$Q\$ and \$R\$ techniques. When all the distances between \$n\$ points are known a method is derived which finds their co-ordinates referred to principal axes. A set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a solution to exist in real Euclidean space is found. \$Q\$ and \$R\$ techniques are defined as being dual to one another when they both lead to a set of \$n\$ points with the same inter-point distances. Pairs of dual techniques are derived. In factor analysis the distances between points whose co-ordinates are the estimated factor scores can be interpreted as \$D{\textasciicircum}2\$ with a singular dispersion matrix.},

She offers an intersubjective approach to personality, based on a constructionist conception of meanings that focus on the concept of "semantic polarities" (fear/courage, good/evil, etc). Each client who presents with one of the disorders discussed, the author argues, has grown up in contexts, in most cases families, where certain specific values and meanings predominate. In each family where a member has a different kind of disorder, conversation will revolve around a different set of values. A central tenant of the model is that meaning and its organizations are open systems, and thus susceptible to modification. Based on this theory, the author shows therapists how use semantics with their clients to help overcome symptoms"--},

Personal construct psychology approaches and narrative psychology approaches, which share philosophical foundations with social constructionism, can be coalesced to provide a substantial theoretical base for the behavioral sciences. The attempt to adapt the principles of each position to an overarching theory provides the impetus for an analysis of the ways in which these perspectives reciprocally supplement each other. The construct random collection of sentences-story is identified as the key construct in the shaping of selfdefining narrative. Propositions which order motivational processes and memory processes readily follow from aligning personal construct psychology and narrative psychology. With these propositions the functioning of a person as a story-teller may be cast in terms which allow a broad range of explanation, as well as investigations which are acceptable within a framework of currently acceptable epistemic values.},

This study addressed this gap by asking 19 practicing IT PMs to describe the skills that successful IT PMs exhibit. A semi-structured interview method known as the repertory grid (RepGrid) technique was used to elicit these skills. Nine skill categories emerged: client management, communication, general management, leadership, personal integrity, planning and control, problem solving, systems development and team development. Our study complements existing research by providing a richer understanding of several skills that were narrowly defined (client management, planning and control, and problem solving) and by introducing two new skill categories that had not been previously discussed (personal integrity and team development). Analysis of the individual RepGrids revealed four distinct ways in which study participants combined skill categories to form archetypes of effective IT PMs. We describe these four IT PM archetypes – General Manager, Problem Solver, Client Representative and Balanced Manager – and discuss how this knowledge can be useful for practitioners, researchers and educators. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research.},

The findings from the study of 195 graduate social work students demonstrate that factors contributing to statistics anxiety include math phobia, lack of relevance to social work, instructor's characteristics, and classroom environment. Among the preferred instructional methods students identified helpful strategies such as instructors' being attentive to students' anxiety, setting a slow course pace, and providing additional tutoring. The study findings suggested three major areas for enhancing statistics learning: (1) fostering environment that is nonthreatening, friendly, and conducive to learning; (2) clarifying statistical concepts in plain terms; and (3) offering practical skills relevant to students' field of specialization.},

In this context four profiling methods; sorting, projective mapping, flash profile and repertory grid method (RGM) were explored among target consumers of hot beverages in two European countries (UK and France) with the assumption that meaningful sensory descriptors can be generated and quantified, and that product maps can ultimately be drawn. A quantitative descriptive analysis was also performed with a trained panel and its outcomes were used as a basis for comparison. Results showed that consumers were able to describe and quantify product differences, that their perception was similar on a cross-country level, that trained panel maps translated well consumers description, and that flash profiling and RGM were more suitable for such a task as they generate a rich vocabulary and more accurate maps. However, when describing complex attributes as mouthfeel or afterfeel, the consumers description was not enough detailed or not consensual.},

The purpose of the study presented here is to compare attributes of a low involvement product, viz. vegetable oil, elicited by five different techniques on a number of dimensions directed from theories of consumer buying behaviour. Although a number of differences between the techniques are identified in the study, the main findings are that the robustness of the different techniques for attribute elicitation is considerable.PsycINFO classification: 2260; 3920},

Instead of being construed exclusively as a measure of good education, school success can be seen as the effect of normalization based on the power of discourses dominating in a society.

The first study showed that secondary students employed many more subjective criteria to classify 32 foods than nutrition students. In the second study, nutrition and secondary students’ constructs of eight fruits and vegetables were elicited by means of a pairwise comparison technique. The students then rated these foods along their own constructs. The foods and constructs were related to each other by means of principal components analyses. The results indicated that the secondary students construed the foods in more evaluative and sensory terms than the, nutrition students, who were more concerned with processing and physical appearance. The significance of the results is discussed in relation to the style of thinking associated with adolescence and young adulthood, and to the professional roles of nutrition students.

At every insertion, the updated centroid, redetermined by the new considered points, is compared with the previous by way of the common elements. If significant variations of the similarity transformation parameters occur, they reveal the presence of outliers or non stationary points among the new elements just inserted.},

	doi = {10.1177/0146167205275613},
	abstract = {Theoretically, low correlations between implicit and explicit measures can be due to (a) motivational biases in explicit self reports, (b) lack of introspective access to implicitly assessed representations, (c) factors influencing the retrieval of information from memory, (d) method-related characteristics of the two measures, or (e) complete independence of the underlying constructs. The present study addressed these questions from a meta-analytic perspective, investigating the correlation between the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and explicit self-report measures. Based on a sample of 126 studies, the mean effect size was .24, with approximately half of the variability across correlations attributable to moderator variables. Correlations systematically increased as a function of (a) increasing spontaneity of self-reports and (b) increasing conceptual correspondence between measures. These results suggest that implicit and explicit measures are generally related but that higher order inferences and lack of conceptual correspondence can reduce the influence of automatic associations on explicit self-reports.

This enables Similarity to be expressed numerically, and would allow taxonomic rank to be measured in terms of it. An example in bacteria is given, and the results compared with the conventional classification. The method is to count the number of similar and of dissimilar features between strains and to sort the strains into groups whose members have a high percentage of similarities.},

In parallel, consumer testing using the repertory grid technique was conducted with consumers representing 5 different European countries. Generalized Procrustes Analysis of the repertory grid data suggested a cross-cultural consensus with respect to consumer perception of mealiness. In particular, mealiness was associated with the texture of Cox apples. Curved box-plots, an innovative extension of ordinary box-plots, was used to explore the consumers'use of descriptive attributes. This indicated that although consumers perceived mealiness similarly, they described their perceptions differently.},

	abstract = {Clustering of objects according to shapes is of key importance in many scientific fields. In this paper we focus on the case where the shape of an object is represented by a configuration matrix of landmarks. It is well known that this shape space has a finite-dimensional Riemannian manifold structure (non-Euclidean) which makes it difficult to work with. Papers about clustering on this space are scarce in the literature. The basic foundation of the kkk-means algorithm is the fact that the sample mean is the value that minimizes the Euclidean distance from each point to the centroid of the cluster to which it belongs, so, our idea is integrating the Procrustes type distances and Procrustes mean into the kkk-means algorithm to adapt it to the shape analysis context. As far as we know, there have been just two attempts in that way. In this paper we propose to adapt the classical kkk-means Lloyd algorithm to the context of Shape Analysis, focusing on the three dimensional case. We present a study comparing its performance with the Hartigan-Wong kkk-means algorithm, one that was previously adapted to the field of Statistical Shape Analysis. We demonstrate the better performance of the Lloyd version and, finally, we propose to add a trimmed procedure. We apply both to a 3D database obtained from an anthropometric survey of the Spanish female population conducted in this country in 2006. The algorithms presented in this paper are available in the Anthropometry R package, whose most current version is always available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.},

The method focuses on the individuality of each person’s attempt at making sense of her/his caring world. Previous papers have focused on a discussion of the repertory grid technique as a research method and tool for psychiatric nurses, an overview of studies using this technique with nurses and social workers, and applications of personal construct theory (from which the technique is derived) to nursing research. A paper by Rawlinson described content analysis of the role constructs elicited from the nurses. In this study, content analysis of caring constructs elicited by nurses and residents was also undertaken, and the results are presented. Additionally, principal component analysis of the repertory grids was carried out, and three examples are presented. This combined analysis provides an in-depth insight into nurses’ perceptions of caring for others; perceptions which guide their caring behaviours. This information can be used by individual nurses to review their caring practice.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Practical limitations in epidemiologic research may necessitate use of only a few questions for assessing the complex phenomenon called "stress." The objective of this study was to evaluate the measurement characteristics of 2 single-item measures on the amount of stress and the ability to handle stress.
METHODS: We selected 218 adults age 50 to 76 years living in western Washington state from a large prospective cohort study of lifestyle factors and cancer risk to evaluate the 3-month test-retest reliability and intermethod reliability of the stress questions. To assess the latter, we compared 2 single-item measures on stress with 3 more fully validated multi-item instruments on perceived stress, daily hassles, and life events, which assessed the same underlying constructs as the single-item measures.
RESULTS: The test-retest reliabilities for the single-item stress measures were good (kappa and intraclass correlations between 0.66 and 0.74). The intermethod reliabilities comparing the 2 single-item stress measures with 3 multi-item instruments were moderate (r = 0.31-0.46) and comparable to correlations observed among the 3 multi-item instruments (r = 0.25-0.47).
CONCLUSIONS: The 2 single-item stress measures are reliable at measuring stress with validity similar to longer questionnaires. Single-item measures offer a practical instrument for assessing stress in large prospective epidemiologic studies that lack space for longer instruments.},

The proposed technique differs from methods advocated by Dwyer and MacPhail (1948) and Wrobleski (1963) in several respects, notably in a deliberate limitation on the classes of scalar functions considered: traces and determinants. To narrow interest to these two classes of scalar matrix functions allows one to invoke certain algebraic identities which simplifies the problem, because (a) the treatment of traces of products of matrices can be reduced to that of a few representatives of large equivalence classes of such products, all having the same formal derivative, and because (b) the more involved task of differentiating determinants of matrix products can be translated into the more amenable problem of differentiating the traces of such products. A number of illustrative examples are included in an attempt to show that the above limitation is not as serious as might at first appear, because traces and determinants apply to a wide range of psychometric and statistical problems.},

In this paper I analyze the resources used to produce these matters of fact, paying particular attention to linguistic practices. Experimental reports rich in circumstantial detail were designed to enable readers of the text to create a mental image of an experimental scene they did not directly witness. I call this `virtual witnessing', and its importance was as a means of enlarging the witnessing public. The notion of a `public' for experimental science is, I argue, essential to our understanding of how facts are generated and validated. In these episodes, circumstantial reporting was a technique for creating a public and for constituting authentic knowledge.},

Formulas for determining the limits of the effect of using the approximate solution are presented. The method is applied to a set of twenty hypothetical tests, defined by their loadings on four orthogonal primary traits. After factoring the inter-correlations of these variables by Thurstone's centroid method, approximating the diagonals, the original hypothetical matrix is reproduced with a root mean square discrepancy of .014 by assuming as known the primary trait loadings of only the first eight tests. The method is applied to the results of factoring two batteries of 14 tests, having 8 tests in common, to give the factor loadings of the two batteries on the same reference axes. The method provides a means of comparing directly and quantitatively the results of two different factor studies, provided they have tests in common, and of testing the stability of simple structure under changes in the battery. The relations of the method here developed to certain problems in multiple correlation are shown.},

Much of the knowledge generated in NPD is tacit; it is difficult to express, connected with problem solving, and dependent on the interactions within teams. Post-project reviews (PPRs) are recognized as a highly effective mechanism for stimulating learning in NPD teams but, surprisingly, neither the typical “lessons learnt” that emerge from PPRs nor the role of tacit knowledge in NPD learning have previously been studied. To address this gap, five in-depth case studies were conducted at leading German companies. Three main sources of data were used: interviews with experienced NPD personnel using repertory grid technique, inspection of company process and project documentation, and observations of PPR discussions. Systematic coding of the qualitative data was conducted by two researchers working in parallel and verified through checks involving independent researchers. The coding process identified the lessons learnt and also the usage of metaphors and stories (which signifies tacit knowledge generation).},

Computer graphics have stimulated interest in the perceptual pros and cons of different formats for displaying data. One way of evaluating the effectiveness of a display is to measure the efficiency (as defined by signal-detection theory) with which an observer extracts information from the graph. We measured observers’ efficiencies in detecting differences in the means or variances of pairs of data sets sampled from Gaussian distributions. Sample size ranged from 1 to 20 for viewing times of 0.3 or 1 sec. The samples were displayed in three formats: numerical tables, scatterplots, and luminance-coded displays. Efficiency was highest for the scatterplots (≅60\% for both means and variances) and was only weakly dependent on sample size and exposure time. The pattern of results suggests parallel perceptual computation in which a constant proportion of the available information is used. Efficiency was lowest for the numerical tables and depended more strongly on sample size and viewing time. The results suggest serial processing in which a fixed amount of the available information is processed in a given time.},

Damit werden zwei Anforderungen erfüllt: Der Wirklichkeitsbezug gründet in den Erzählungen der Akteure über ihre jeweilige Lebenswelt, die Verallgemeinerungsfähigkeit begründet sich in der regelgeleiteten Datenaufbereitung und -interpretation im Rahmen legitimierter Paradigmen (KUHN). Auf diese Weise soll eine größere Nähe zwischen theoretischer, grundlagenorientierter Forschung und konkreter Anwendung, etwa in Planung oder Beratung, gewährleistet werden. Nach einem knappen einführenden Blick auf das interdisziplinäre und psychologische Mobilitätsverständnis werden die Anforderungen an das konkrete Forschungsprojekt "psychologische Grundlagen des Mobilitätshandelns" abgeleitet. Im Kern des Beitrags werden dann Gütekriterien an das einzusetzende Verfahren formuliert und in einer konkreten Beschreibung des methodischen Vorgehens untersucht.

	abstract = {Hot on the heals of the award-winning and best selling Discovering Statistics Using SPSS, Third Edition, Andy Field has teamed up with Jeremy Miles (co-author of Discovering Statistics Using SAS) to write Discovering Statistics Using R. Keeping the uniquely humorous and self-depreciating style that has made students across the world fall in love with Andy Field's books, Discovering Statistics Using R takes students on a journey of statistical discovery using the freeware R, a free, flexible and dynamically changing software tool for data analysis that is becoming increasingly popular across the social and behavioural sciences throughout the world. The journey begins by explaining basic statistical and research concepts before a guided tour of the R software environment. Next the importance of exploring and graphing data will be discovered, before moving onto statistical tests that are the foundations of the rest of the book (for e.g. correlation and regression). Readers will then stride confidently into intermediate level analyses such as ANOVA, before ending their journey with advanced techniques such as MANOVA and multilevel models. Although there is enough theory to help the reader gain the necessary conceptual understanding of what they're doing, the emphasis is on applying what's learned to playful and real-world examples that should make the experience more fun than expected. Like its sister textbooks, Discovering Statistics Using R is written in an irreverent style and follows the same ground-breaking structure and pedagogical approach. The core material is augmented by a cast of characters to help the reader on their way, hundreds of examples, self-assessment tests to consolidate knowledge, and additional website material for those wanting to learn more (at www.sagepub.co.uk/fieldandmilesR). Given this book's accessibility, fun spirit, and use of bizarre real-world research it should be essential for anyone wanting to learn about statistics using the freely-available R software.},

In particular, the covariance biplot technique is focused on and the resulting graphical output, called the conflict diagram, is interpreted in terms of relationships between actors, profiles of alternatives under consideration, and the interactions between actors and alternatives in terms of the conflict and its possible resolutions (consensus, coalition, etc.). The conflict analysis is divided into two distinct phases. The descriptive phase is used to represent the conflict. The prescriptive phase is used in two ways: (i) to visualize the effects of changes in parameters (‘conflict resolution aid’), hopefully bringing the actors closer together, and (ii) as a tool to enhance the creative search for new alternatives (‘alternative generation’). The conflict analysis process is illustrated by examining ex post a practical case study in water resource management. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Some problems in the use and interpretation of such constructs were explored experimentally. Ten male medical student volunteers acted as subjects. The results indicate that direct ratings of figures and comparable grid scores are not equivalent, and reveal various kinds of discrepancy from expectations concerning: (a) relations between one whole-figure construct (like self) and personal constructs elicited to define ‘like’ and ‘unlike self’ characteristics; (b) relations between supplied constructs matching highly with like self and elicited constructs defining self and non-self; (c) relations among and between elicited ‘like’ and ‘unlike self’ constructs. Limitations of the present grid form are discussed in the light of these findings, and interpretations of some of the discrepancies are suggested.},

	abstract = {The repertory grid method (RGM) was initially devised to determine how individuals construe their worlds. There have been many attempts to extend this principle to look at relationships amongst objects, as seen by groups of individuals. However, to derive the implied consensus representation of the objects, poses conceptual and mathematical problems because of the idiosyncratic nature of constructs elicited using RGM. Generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA) offers a solution since there is no assumption of common interpretation of constructs. It is an implicit but apparently untested assumption of GPA, that mathematical and perceptual structure are analogous. To test this, combined RGM/GPA was applied to color. Using the method of triads, 24 subjects independently described constructs to characterize 26 Munsell color chips differing in Hue, Value and Chroma. Subjects then rated the colors on their own construct scales. The first six dimensions of the consequent color space were interpreted as brightness, greenness, lightness, purple/blueness, redness and yellowness. This differs from expectation only in that the colors were recovered on uni-polar dimensions rather than red-green and blue-yellow continua. However, since the main perceptual attributes of color were recovered the analogy assumption of GPA is supported, as is application to repertory grids.},

A current research challenge is to understand gamers' persistent involvement with games by considering their social practices within and around the game. This is important as it may have an impact on how we design successful technology-enhanced learning experiences. A Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG), World of Warcraft was investigated. Data were collected from a large-scale online survey (1051 responses) as well as in-depth interviews. Findings revealed a range of collaborative and competitive relationships developed during gameplay. What motivates ongoing long-term participation was found to be social praxis along with significant others i.e., online and real-life friends as well as family members. Gaming becomes habitual when overcoming the boundaries of virtuality to become blurred with reality.},

The alternate questionnaire for each individual comprised free choice vocabulary. Half of each consumer sample used the consensus questionnaire and the other half, the free choice questionnaire first, and indicated how often they would consume each meat product in the various contexts listed using graphic line scales of 100 mm anchored at either end by the words never and always. After an interval of time, the alternate questionnaire was completed. It was found that similar conclusions can be drawn about major contextual dimensions either by principal component analysis of data from a consensus questionnaire or by generalized Procrustes analysis of data from free choice profiling.},

Inferences about the transformation and about the parameters of the linear model are made by computing the likelihood function and the relevant posterior distribution. The contributions of normality, homoscedasticity and additivity to the transformation are separated. The relation of the present methods to earlier procedures for finding transformations is discussed. The methods are illustrated with examples.},

This article explores a bootstrap approach to clustering that additionally allows significance testing of dendrogram structures. Given that the choice of the specific clustering method and distance measure can be justified, the method yields indications of closely related element or construct structures. Closely integrated groups of constructs link to the concept of cognitive complexity. Several new complexity indexes are derived from the bootstrap solution. The behavior of the indexes is compared (a) across the most common clustering methods and distance measures and (b) to standard complexity measures. The derived measures reflect a different aspect of complexity than standard measures.},

These methods are briefly illustrated and explained under our model. A series of simulations to compare their performance has been carried out. We found significant differences in performance depending on the variance of random errors and on the dimensionality of the true underlying consensus. Therefore, we investigated on the dimensionality of the calculated group averages. We found both methods gave too many dimensions compared to the true consensus. This finding is supported by some theoretical considerations. Finally we propose a combined approach which takes advantage of both methods and which gave better results in the simulations.},

Therefore, both measures are useless for answering questions of the type: “DoesA fitB better thanA fitsC?”.

Pvclust can be used easily for general statistical problems, such as DNA microarray analysis, to perform the bootstrap analysis of clustering, which has been popular in phylogenetic analysis. Pvclust calculates probability values (p-values) for each cluster using bootstrap resampling techniques. Two types of p-values are available: approximately unbiased (AU) p-value and bootstrap probability (BP) value. Multiscale bootstrap resampling is used for the calculation of AU p-value, which has superiority in bias over BP value calculated by the ordinary bootstrap resampling. In addition the computation time can be enormously decreased with parallel computing option.},

Both sets of data were submitted to generalized Procrustes analysis. Applications associated with animals or human genetic material were described as causing ethical concern, being unnatural, harmful, and dangerous. Those involving plants or microorganisms were described as beneficial, progressive, and necessary. The results were validated in survey research, which indicated that general applications ofgenetic engineering were perceived as either positive or negative, whereas specific applications were more highly differentiated in perceptual terms.

Developmental processes have to be analyzed at the level of individual subjects, using time series data characterizing the patterns of intra-individual variation. It is shown that standard statistical techniques based on the analysis of inter-individual variation appear to be insensitive to the presence of arbitrary large degrees of inter-individual heterogeneity in the population. An important class of nonlinear epigenetic models of neural growth is described which can explain the occurrence of such heterogeneity in brain structures and behavior. Links with models of developmental instability are discussed. A simulation study based on a chaotic growth model illustrates the invalidity of standard analysis of inter-individual variation, whereas time series analysis of intra-individual variation is able to recover the true state of affairs. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Sensory characterization is one of the most powerful, sophisticated, and extensively applied tools in sensory science. Descriptive analysis with trained assessors has been traditionally used for sensory characterization. Due to the cost of time and money required for its application, several novel methodologies, which do not require training, have been recently developed and are gaining popularity as quick and reliable options for gathering sensory information. These methodologies enable the study of consumers' perceptions of the sensory characteristics of products. However, information on these techniques is scattered in scientific journal articles, which hinders their application and creates a need for a book to assemble the details of the latest advances.Novel Techniques in Sensory Characterization and Consumer Profiling provides a comprehensive overview of classical and novel methods for sensory characterization of food and nonfood products. The book presents the history behind descriptive analysis, describes the most common novel methodologies and detailed information for their implementation, and discusses examples of applications and case studies. It also includes an introduction to exploratory multivariate analysis, addressing the theory and application of some of the most useful multivariate statistical tools applied in the analysis of consumer profiling data sets.Most of the data analysis is implemented in the statistical free software R, making the book accessible to readers unfamiliar with complex statistical software.Chapters examine a range of techniques including the ideal profile method, just-about-right scales in consumer research, free choice profiling, flash profiling, and repertory grid methods. They cover emerging profiling methods, such as sorting, and projective mapping or Napping®. Other techniques less frequently used for sensory profiling are also considered: the application of open-ended questions for sensory characterization, polarized sensory positioning, and the consumer-friendly check-all-that-apply questions. In addition, dynamic sensory characterization methods, useful for studying temporal aspects of in-mouth sensory perception, are described. The final chapter provides a critical comparison of the methodologies discussed, their advantages and disadvantages, and general recommendations for their application.},

	abstract = {This article provides researchers with a guide to properly construe and conduct analyses of conditional indirect effects, commonly known as moderated mediation effects. We disentangle conflicting definitions of moderated mediation and describe approaches for estimating and testing a variety of hypotheses involving conditional indirect effects. We introduce standard errors for hypothesis testing and construction of confidence intervals in large samples but advocate that researchers use bootstrapping whenever possible. We also describe methods for probing significant conditional indirect effects by employing direct extensions of the simple slopes method and Johnson-Neyman technique for probing significant interactions. Finally, we provide an SPSS macro to facilitate the implementation of the recommended asymptotic and bootstrapping methods. We illustrate the application of these methods with an example drawn from the Michigan Study of Adolescent Life Transitions, showing that the indirect effect of intrinsic student interest on mathematics performance through teacher perceptions of talent is moderated by student math self-concept.},

An attraction of grids is the potential to examine subjectivity through such ‘quantitative’ analyses. In contrast, significantly less use has been made of approaches for analysing the content of construing. Content analysis has the potential to provide techniques for systematically analysing construct content. However, content analysis raises some fundamental questions for PCP researchers and practitioners. The present paper reviews the various approaches taken by PCP researchers to content analysis. Limitations associated with these approaches are discussed along with recommendations for future PCP content analyses.},

Dabei wird die Milieuforschung verstanden als ein neues Paradigma der Sozialstrukturforschung und gleichzeitig als ein Bereich, in dem die Integration qualitativer und quantitativer Methoden beispielhaft erfolgt. Im Zentrum stehen die prominenten Milieumodelle von Gerhard SCHULZE und Sinus Sociovision. Differenziert wird zwischen dem Milieumodell, das die Einteilung der Gesellschaft in Lebensstilgemeinschaften darstellt ("Milieu-Landkarte") und dem Milieuinstrument, das das zugehörige Instrumentarium quantitativer und qualitativer Methoden ist, um die Milieueinteilung zu (re)produzieren und einzelne Produkte in der Marktforschung quantitativ und interpretativ auf die Milieus zu beziehen. Zwei Problematiken werden vorrangig behandelt: 1. Durch die theoretische und methodische Komplexität der Milieuforschung ergibt sich ein Akzeptanz- und Vermittlungsproblem in der Praxis der Marktforschung. Theorievermittlung im Beratungsprozess und die Einbindung des Kunden in die Interpretationsarbeit wird zum Erfolgskriterium der Marktforschung. 2. Die Feldlogik (hier ist der Bezug BOURDIEUs Feldkonzept) der kommerziellen Milieuforschung führt zu einer Strategie von Marktforschungsunternehmen, das eigene Milieumodell zum Standard machen zu wollen und gleichzeitig das technische Wissen um das Milieuinstrument und dessen kommerzielle Verwertung zu monopolisieren. Letzteres führt für die wissenschaftliche Sozialstrukturforschung zu einer Infragestelllung der Validität und damit zu einem Rezeptionshindernis avancierter kommerzieller Milieuforschung.

The transformation is made so that multiple score and loading matrices are optimally matched to two unknown target matrices, respectively, without affecting the fit of the score and loading matrices to data sets, and without any constraint imposed on the transformation, except for its being nonsingular. The resulting transformed score and loading matrices can reasonably be compared across data sets. A simulation study is performed for assessing an alternate least-squares algorithm for GJPA. Additional procedures for interpreting GJPA solutions are also presented and they are illustrated with a real data example. Finally, GJPA is reconsidered in the contexts of three-way data analysis and canonical correlation analysis.},

	abstract = {Sensory characterisation of virgin olive oil is completely standardised in the European Union. The sensory profile used to evaluate samples is made up of 16 descriptors, three of them being generic. These three attributes [Other ripe fruit(s), Other positive attribute(s) and Other negative attribute(s)] could be of great additional interest in the characterisation of different samples. However, as they are not specifically defined it is difficult to reach a descriptor consensus among assessors evaluating the samples. This situation is similar to that produced when using a Free Choice Profile and so the Generalised Procrustes Analysis (GPA) could be extremely useful in obtaining all the information contained in these three generic descriptors. In this study GPA was applied to the descriptors generated by a 25 member expert panel under the headings Other ripe fruits and Other positive attributes when evaluating 11 samples of virgin olive oil from the variety ‘Arbequina’ grown in three different regions. The Generalised Procrustes Analysis was efficient in the sensory characterisation of the 11 samples studied using the information provided by the two positive generic descriptors included in the official sensory profile. The overall result was equivalent to that obtained using Correspondence Analysis, although the GPA gave more information since it also included the intensity of each of the descriptors and was less affected by odd descriptors. This technique was as useful in the characterisation of the samples as the other six positive descriptors defined in the official sensory profile (Olive fruity, Apple, Green, Sweet, Bitter, and Pungent), providing additional information of great scientific and commercial interest.},

A disadvantage of such   strict   statistical methods is that assumptions should be fulfilled to be able to perform statistical testing. In practice the assumptions are seldom checked.  The exploratory use of methods of multivariate data analysis may be a good alternative.  The sometimes heard criticism that these methods suffer from a lack of experimental design, could be countered by realising that there are certain, implicit, design-choices associated with the use of these methods. Furthermore the paper presents the use of permutation tests as a means to test the results from an exploratory MVA method (PCA).  It is concluded that permutation tests can almost always be performed for determining significant deviations from an alternative random explanation of the effects in the data.},

	abstract = {Predictive biplots, as developed by J.C. Gower and coworkers, can be a very useful tool to aid the interpretation of the outcomes of multivariate analyses. This paper covers a statistical methodology that enables the automation of the construction of predictive biplots, as well as an R function, AutoBiplots.PCA( ), which applies the methodology to principal components analysis. A case study based on the sensory analysis of coffees is used to illustrate the methodology as well as the outputs of the R function. The method relies on the definition of a variable's mean standard predictive error, mspe, as the degree of accuracy in the process of predicting the original values from the biplots, which is compared with a predefined tolerance value (Taxis) to decide if the correspondent biplot axis is drawn in the biplot. Standard predictive errors, spe, are calculated for each unit in relation to each biplot axis in each two-dimensional plot and are compared with a predefined tolerance value (Tunits) to decide which units shall be faced as outliers. The R function automates the process, enabling the user to decide on the degree of precision of the actual analysis. Besides providing a solution for the automatic production of predictive biplots, the methodology offers new insights for the interpretation of multivariate analyses outputs on the basis of a sound principle, the degree of precision of the analysis. This provides an automatic way for the selection of variables that explain latent dimensions and also helps in deciding on the number of important latent dimensions for model developments.

The more structured repertory grid method has been used as an alternative procedure, and is thought to help assessors in vocabulary development. To compare these two procedures, panels of assessors used them to describe the sensory properties of 25 ciders. Generalized Procrustes analyses of the two data sets provided broadly similar results, but the repertory grid method yielded more descriptors and interpretation of the resulting product space was slightly easier. However, the repertory grid method took slightly longer to carry out, and it was concluded that neither method was clearly superior.},

The distinction between signal and noise plays an important part in explaining how different methods are suitable for exploring different aspects of the data, rather than being viewed as competing methods with the same general objectives. Explanations are largely set in a geometrical context, thus keeping technical mathematics to a minimum; a common Analysis of Variance framework allows all the methods to be considered in a unified way and suggests some new ways in which these kinds of data may be analysed.

The relative positions of samples were similar for the consumers and the trained assessors' consensus spaces but the latter resulted in a better separation of samples. Boskoop samples were perceived as more acid, astringent, crispy and hard while the Cox variety was described as sweeter and more floury. Jonagold samples were perceived as juicier and occupied an intermediate position, with the mealy Jonagold sample closer to the Cox samples. The agreement between sample spaces showed that both panels perceived the major differences between samples in a similar way but the trained panel was able to differentiate further, mainly between the texture characteristics.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
This study (1) examines the sensory attributes of a large group of red apples and compares consumer perceptions of them with those of a trained sensory panel; and (2) uses a sensory semantic frame classification to analyze the vocabulary used. Descriptive analysis was carried out with the trained panel, while a simplified version of the repertory grid method was used for one-to-one interviews with consumers. The perceptions expressed by the consumers correlated quite well with the terminology used by the trained panel, and the two groups used many identical words when describing the apples' texture, flavor and taste according to partial least squares regression. A sensory semantic frame was constructed based on the vocabulary used by the two groups. The combination of sensory and semantic analysis could be one way of extracting valuable words for use in contexts such as product description for marketing purposes in retail stores.
PRACTICAL APPLICATION
To increase and optimize consumer experiences of fruits and vegetables, it is crucial to use the proper words, both informatively and esthetically, to express these sense experiences. Often, however, it can be difficult to describe the taste, flavor, scent and texture of the food we eat. An agreed-on sensory and semantic language for apples, for example, could be valuable for effective communication in retail stores, to improve selling statistics, consumption and consumer quality awareness.The key outcome of the study is that the perceptions of the trained panel and the consumers were quite similar, and that the combination of sensory and semantic methodology could be a valuable tool to create sensory characteristics of products to be used in effective marketing communication in grocery retail stores. Future research could investigate consumer decision-making in relation to sensory and semantic description labels in retail grocery stores.},

A noteworthy feature of this procedure is that each isotropic scaling factor is shown to be the product of a standardisation scalar which adjusts for the differences in range of scoring among assessors, and a performance index. An overall performance index for the whole panel is also discussed. The performance indices can be useful in improving the performance of the panel by pointing out whether further training is required for the whole panel or for some specific assessors. Once the isotropic scaling factors are determined, it is possible to derive a group average configuration using one of several algorithms proposed in the statistical literature which aim at matching a set of configurations by means of rotations. A data set is analysed and a simulation study is undertaken in order to demonstrate the method, and the outcomes are compared to those obtained by means of Gower's algorithm for Generalised Procrustes Analysis.},

To compare replicates, scores from Procrustes analysis of the original data were subjected to Procrustes analysis. The results showed that panelists assessment of replicates was consistent. Regression of the scores from this second Procrustes analysis showed that they were well explained by the linear effects of either moisture in nonfat solids or fat content. Panelists who performed differently from the rest could be identified. Panelists were more sensitive to changes in moisture in nonfat solids content than fat.

Findings revealed four aspects of symbolic meaning of childbearing focused on the informant's sense of self, cultural values, existential purpose, and relations with others. The results also depicted infertility as a form of disenfranchised grief, following ambiguous loss, underscoring the need for counselors to explore the meaning of childbearing among IVF service users and the impact on their self-narratives as a function of treatment outcome.},

Significant sample differences were found for 19 of the 20 attributes. Generalized Procrustes Analysis was also applied to the individual assessor matrices for odour, flavour and texture as a method of data simplification that allows for differences between assessors. Consensus models were fitted which accounted for 41–58\% of the total variation after rotation and scaling. These models were of low dimensionality and were used to construct perceptual space maps. Interpretation of the individual dimensions in terms of the original attributes was achieved by correlation and projection methods. This allowed the key elements of the sensory properties of hard cheese to be identified.},

Findings suggest that coach self-awareness and awareness of the coachee are important to both coachees and coaches; adaptation of the coach to the individual coachee was important to some participants; that the bond and collaboration were perceived differently by participants, however not by coachees and coaches; and that trust was a key aspect of bond and engagement. The quality of interpersonal interactions between coachee and coach, and an emphasis on co-creation of the coaching relationship were highlighted as superordinate themes subsuming several of the study's findings. Recommendations for coaching research and practice and implications of the study's findings are also discussed.},

To eliminate this indeterminacy on nonsingular transformation, we propose Joint Procrustes Analysis (JPA) in which component score and loading matrices are simultaneously transformed so that the former matrix matches a target score matrix and the latter matches a target loading matrix. The loss function of JPA is a function of the nonsingular transformation matrix and its inverse, and is difficult to minimize straightforwardly. To deal with this difficulty, we reparameterize those matrices by their singular value decomposition, which reduces the minimization to alternately solving quartic equations and performing the existing multivariate procedures. This algorithm is assessed in a simulation study. We further extend JPA for cases where targets are linear functions of unknown parameters. We also discuss how the application of JPA can be extended in different fields.},

This study explores the motivational factors and dimensions underlying tourists’ food consumption through a combined repertory grid method (RGM) and generalised Procrustes analysis (GPA) approach. By employing the RGM triadic elicitation technique, a total of 14 motivational factors was yielded (i.e., authentic experience, prestige, cultural knowledge, health concern, assurance, convenience, price and value, novelty, variety, familiarity, eating habit, sensory pleasure, social pleasure, and contextual pleasure). Content analysis and GPA results further categorised the factors into five dimensions (i.e., symbolic, obligatory, contrast, extension, and pleasure). Based on the findings, a conceptual framework was developed to illustrate how tourist food consumption can be differentiated into supporting consumer experience, peak touristic experience (contrast), peak touristic experience (symbolic) and “attractionised” experience.},

The application of repertory grid techniques (n = 26) in conjunction with generalized Procrustes analysis identified important psychological constructs which determine attitude. A larger survey study (n = 227) examined the reliability and predictive capacity of these items in quantifying attitudes to technology. Factor analysis identified two sub-scales, which appeared to assess perceptions of technological risk and benefit. Internal reliability of the two sub-scales was high, and had pleasing face validity and predictive capacity. An inverse relationship between perceived risk and benefit was found, consistent with previous research in risk perception. Discussion is made of reducing inappropriately high risk perceptions through effective communication of benefits, and vice versa, with the caveat that such an effect is only likely to be observed for technologies where public opinion is uncrystallized and knowledge is low.},

Their findings indicate that the three estimation techniques perform about equally well. UAM also is compared with traditional compositional mapping. They find that UAM is superior on fit of the solution, interpretability, and sample reliability. UAM probably holds an edge with respect to data collection. Traditional compositional mapping is superior on ease of data analysis. No major difference was found on predictive validity and structural reliability.},

Data were analyzed using principal component analysis, generalized Procrustes analysis and partial least squares regression. Results indicate that the underlying perceptual structure of the sample spaces obtained from both panels were similar, however, the emphasis on the underlying sensory dimensions differed.

	abstract = {When generalised Procrustes analysis (GPA) is applied to analyse sensory data, it is important to decide the dimensionality, i.e. the number of principal component factors in the final group average space. Normally, it is empirically estimated based on the scree plot of the total explained variance and interpretability of dimensions, and no statistical method is available so far. In this paper, a new randomisation test was developed to detect significant dimensions of group average space obtained by GPA. It was developed from ANOVA and the consensus test which was originally proposed by Wakeling et al. especially for validation of GPA results. The method was applied to one conventional, two free choice profile sensory data sets and three simulated data sets. The results showed that the proposed randomisation F-test is more effective than the scree plot method. Compared with the Wakeling consensus test of GPA, it not only validates the consensus of data, but also identifies the significant dimensions of group average space. It successfully found significant factors for the three sensory data sets, and also correctly detected that there was no consensus in the first two simulated data sets, and there were two significant factors in the third simulated data set.},

	abstract = {Projective mapping has been validated as a practical tool for the rapid sensory profiling of brandy products, although repeatability concerns necessitate repeated measurements in larger sample sets. The reason for poor repeatability could be linked to the complexity of the product type, as well as the physical and possibly psychological factors associated with its high alcohol content. To date no information has been published that tested the effect of these specific factors on panellist performance in projective mapping tasks. This study tested the effect of sample complexity and alcohol content on sensory panel repeatability and accuracy in projective mapping, using six types of commercial alcoholic beverages. In a second objective, the study also tested the effect of prior knowledge of alcohol content of a given product set on panellist performance in projective mapping. The results showed that complexity had the biggest impact on panel performance, while alcohol content had a secondary but decisive influence, largely due to its chemosensory fatiguing nature. Knowledge of the product alcohol content appeared to affect individuals differently, and also had an effect on the terminology used by the panellists to describe the products. The study also introduces the Relative Performance Indicator (RPI) as a new panel performance monitoring tool for projective mapping.},

Whatever the nature of data, a mean configuration of products is built and it is crucial to assess its stability, especially when the judges are untrained. Unfortunately, most of the confidence ellipses constructed around the position of the products do not give a confidence area in the sense that two products are significantly different when their ellipses do not overlap. Indeed, most ellipses proposed in the literature are too small and lead the user to misinterpretations since they are too optimistic. Here we propose to use truncated total bootstrap to build confidence ellipses that can be actually interpreted as confidence areas. The ellipses are evaluated from simulations and real examples and the evaluation shows that the methodology is adequate for all methods.},

Ordination using generalized Procrustes analysis provides a common base for comparing assessors, but the derived configurations are often high-dimensional and difficult to summarize. This problem can be rectified by selecting a small subset of the original set of variables. Methods of variable selection in principal component analysis can be adapted easily for such purposes, but there is no guarantee with these methods that overall data structure is preserved. A recently introduced variable selection procedure that does aim to preserve the data structure as much as possible would seem to be more appropriate. All methods are described and applied to a set of data arising from an attitudinal investigation of meat products. The results indicate that variable selection should be more widely encouraged.},

Beitrags ist es, auf Probleme der Aggregation/Disaggregation von Prozessen
hinzuweisen und Lösungsmöglichkeiten vorzuschlagen. Ein Bezug
zur Idiographie/Nomothetik-Kontroverse wird hergestellt. Es werden vier
Fundamentalsätze zur Aggregation von Prozessen formuliert. Theorem
1 behandelt univariate Verläufe: Es weist auf die Schwierigkeiten
hin, von Aggregatverläufen auf individuelle Verläufe zu
schließen. Theorem 2 warnt bei bivariaten Prozessen vor einem
möglichen Fehlschluß von statischen (querschnittlichen,
interindividuellen) auf prozessuale (intraindividuelle) synchrone
Zusammenhänge. Intra- und interindividuelle Beziehungen sind
konzeptuell und empirisch verschieden. Eine Formel beschreibt den
analytischen Zusammenhang zwischen den Korrelationsformen. Theorem 3
zeigt, daß auch bei Längsschnittuntersuchungen i.a. kein
Schluß von Cross-lagged-panel Korrelationen in der Stichprobe
auf asynchrone Beziehungen beim Individuum möglich ist. Theorem
4 behandelt die Reihenfolge von Aggregation und Prognose und
soll die Argumentation zur Priorität eines mikroanalytischen
(intraindividuellen) Vorgehens unterstützen. Abschließend wird
als Lösung der Probleme eine kombiniert idiographisch-nomothetische
Forschungsstrategie empfohlen.},

	abstract = {A procedure based on the repertory grid method was used to elicit information from twenty-six female consumers, on the intrinsic product characteristics which they individually perceived in a range of thirty-one chocolate confectionery products. Each subject described a private list of attributes, with corresponding line scales, which she ultimately used to rate all the products. Photographs of the confectionery products were used in the elicitation procedure. The resulting product by attribute matrices, which were qualitatively and quantitatively different for each subject, were input to generalised Procrustes analysis, to yield a product space in four dimensions. Individuals' attributes were organised into thirty-seven classes and these were used to interpret the product space. It was the consensus view of this group of consumers, that attributes associated with sharing and the ability to section the product, together with differences in texture, were the main discrimination features separating the products. Other less important factors were also identified.

Using a preference mapping technique, preference ratings were successfully superimposed on the four dimensional product space. This implies that the main discriminating features were important in determining preference. On the first two dimensions, a majority of this exclusively female panel showed a preference for light/airy textured chocolate, and avoided the more chunky products. However, on the third and fourth dimensions, the main direction of preference was towards the milk chocolate products. Chocolate consumption data derived from a diary study could not be similarly related to the product space.},

	abstract = {Perceptions are important in determining performance appraisal system success. The growing body of research in this area has clearly documented the differences in perceptions between appraisers and appraisees. However, many of these findings are predominately based on aspects of the system in judging its overall effectiveness and rely heavily on self-report questionnaire responses with weak methodological rigor. Not much is known about the deeper cognitive perceptions of appraisers and appraisees in better explaining their attitudinal and behavioral outcomes. This paper breaks away from conventional questionnaire-generated perceptions and applies a unique clinical cognitive mapping methodology called the repertory grid technique to elicit the personal constructs of how real respondents perceive appraisal systems based on their real-life experiences. The method allowed the investigation to go much deeper than past research into the core perceptions that influenced respondents' attitudes and subsequent behaviors. Though the findings showed some commonality in personal constructions of appraisal systems with those found in the literature, new constructs, core perceptual dimensions, and collective cognitive maps were elicited for the very first time, opening up new questions and issues for further research. Implications to theory and practice are also discussed. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

A disadvantage of such ‘strict’ statistical methods is that assumptions should be fulfilled to be able to perform statistical testing. In practice the assumptions are seldom checked. The exploratory use of methods of multivariate data analysis may be a good alternative. The sometimes heard criticism that these methods suffer from a lack of experimental design, could be countered by realising that there are certain, implicit, design-choices associated with the use of these methods. Furthermore the paper presents the use of permutation tests as a means to test the results from an exploratory MVA method (PCA). It is concluded that permutation tests can almost always be performed for determining significant deviations from an alternative random explanation of the effects in the data.},

The proposed method interpolates between eigenspaces by analogy from rotation of a hyper-ellipsoid in high dimensional space. Experiments using face images captured in various illumination conditions demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed interpolation method.},

	abstract = {The Mantel test provides a means to test the association between distance matrices and has been widely used in ecological and evolutionary studies. Recently, another permutation test based on a Procrustes statistic (PROTEST) was developed to compare multivariate data sets. Our study contrasts the effectiveness, in terms of power and type I error rates, of the Mantel test and PROTEST. We illustrate the application of Procrustes superimposition to visually examine the concordance of observations for each dimension separately and how to conduct hypothesis testing in which the association between two data sets is tested while controlling for the variation related to other sources of data. Our simulation results show that PROTEST is as powerful or more powerful than the Mantel test for detecting matrix association under a variety of possible scenarios. As a result of the increased power of PROTEST and the ability to assess the match for individual observations (not available with the Mantel test), biologists now have an additional and powerful analytical tool to study ecological and evolutionary relationships.},

An overview is given of a number of ready-made building blocks (derived in earlier publications) from which concrete algorithms are set-up with little effort. These algorithms are based on alternating least squares (block relaxation) and iterative majorization. It is demonstrated how the construction of an algorithm for a particular problem that falls in one of the classes of optimization problems under study, reduces to a simple combination of tools. Also, a procedure is reviewed for setting up a weighted least squares algorithm for any problem for which an unweighted least squares solution is available. All procedures are illustrated by means of examples.},

With this aim, 24 bibliographic sources were used to cover a wide range of specialties. We began by drawing up an explicit protocol in which the research terms were detailed. Then we consulted the bibliographic sources, taking into account a specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. As a result of this process, 973 references were obtained: 468 journal papers, 335 book chapters, 108 doctoral theses, and 62 books. The review also evaluates the types of documents found, the evolution of the number of works published, the repertory grid's fields of application, and the degree of openness to other disciplines. The most relevant authors, their affiliations, countries, and the publication language are also revealed in this article, as well as the major journals contributing to dissemination of the work done with this technique.},

Repertory grids (repgrids) were given on 2 occasions to 16 frequently interacting female university freshmen. On the 1st occasion, Ss were newly acquainted; at the 2nd test, nearly 6 mo. later, friendship groups were identified by sociometric tests. Pairs of friends were found to have more similar personal constructs than nominal pairs of group members, not only on the 2nd repgrid but also on the 1st repgrid, before these friendships had occasion to form. It is hypothesized that after the initial stages of acquaintance, the relationship between an individual's personal constructs and his friendships is 1 of mutual influence. (32 ref.)

These factors will play an important role in how nanotechnology is developed and commercialised. This article aims to identify expert opinion on factors influencing societal response to applications of nanotechnology. Structured interviews with experts on nanotechnology from North West Europe were conducted using repertory grid methodology in conjunction with generalized Procrustes analysis to examine the psychological constructs underlying societal uptake of 15 key applications of nanotechnology drawn from different areas (e.g. medicine, agriculture and environment, chemical, food, military, sports, and cosmetics). Based on expert judgement, the main factors influencing societal response to different applications of nanotechnology will be the extent to which applications are perceived to be beneficial, useful, and necessary, and how 'real' and physically close to the end-user these applications are perceived to be by the public.

A series of studies of 2-dimensional stimuli with separable attributes (including house plants, parallelograms, schematic faces, and histograms), using judgments of similarity and dissimilarity, classification, inference, and recognition errors, all support the coincidence hypothesis. The size of the effect is determined by the separability of the stimuli, the transparency of the dimensional structure, and the discriminability of the levels within each dimension. Applications of the coincidence effect to inductive inference are investigated, and its relations to selective attention and spatial density are discussed. It is concluded that the triangle inequality and segmental additivity cannot be jointly satisfied for separable attributes. The implications of this result for multidimensional scaling are discussed.

This chapter introduces the kinds of sensory data to which generalized procrustes analysis (GPA) can be applied, along with the rationale for using the method. The theory of GPA is provided with special attention for the procrustes analysis of variance. Finally, two applications of GPA to sensory profiling data, one conventional and one free-choice, are shown. The chapter presents the results of a GPA and the results of GPA are displayed in a two-dimensional plot. The analysis of variance is an important tool in interpreting the results, as is the PCA that enables inspection of a low-dimensional projection of the group average. When analyzing sensory-instrumental data, often only two data matrices are involved of which one may contain the results of some previous analysis like PCA or even another GPA. Such a datamatrix with the PCA or GPA result does not have variables as columns but dimensions. This variant of GPA combines the procrustes transformations with a projection onto a low-dimensional space.},

The two methods are the correction for attenuation formula and factor analysis. The two levels of analysis are the group level (10, 682 classes) and the individual level (323, 262 students). Reliability estimates were higher using factor analysis (.88) than the correction for attenuation formula (.64), and they were higher using group-level data (.82) than individual-level data (.70). Based on the assumptions and limitations of each method used, the authors conclude that a minimum estimate of .80 for single-item reliability is reasonable for group-level data.

	abstract = {A usual way of thinking about the relationship between personal construct psychology (PCP) and social constructionism (SC) is treating them as two separate entities that are similar in some aspects, but also very different in others. This paper aims at exploring some of the possible implications of reframing the relationship between PCP and SC. I point to two important implications: treating PCP as a discourse and adding a new metaphor of the person. Finally, I argue that the invitation to reframe the relationship between PCP and SC extends both approaches and offers more than each of them alone. On one hand, it extends and enriches SC theory and points to benefits of applying the PCP “toolkit” to constructionist therapy and research. On the other hand, proposed reframing contributes to PCP theory and points to new ways of addressing social construction in therapeutic conversations.},

Implicative dilemmas appear in one third of the non-clinical group (n = 321) and in about half of the clinical group (n = 286), the latter having a proportion of dilemmas that doubles that of the non-clinical sample. Within the clinical group, we studied 87 subjects, after completing a psychotherapy process, and found that therapy helps to dissolve those dilemmas. We also studied, independently, a group of subjects diagnosed with social phobia (n = 13) and a group diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (n = 13) in comparison to non-clinical groups. In both health related problems, dilemmas seem to be quite relevant. Altogether, these studies, though preliminary (and with a small group size in some cases), yield a promising perspective to the unexplored area of the role of cognitive conflicts as an issue to consider when trying to understand some clinical conditions, as well as a focus to be dealt with in psychotherapy when dilemmas are identified.},

from samples of three varieties of apples (Cox, Jonagold and Boskoop) from three different harvest dates each (early, middle,
and late harvest). The aims of this work were to study whether consumers perceived different degrees of mealiness and to compare
the perceptual spaces of samples obtained from consumer data and from conventional profiling with a trained panel, using Generalized
Procrustes analysis. The relative positions of samples were similar for the consumers and the trained assessors' consensus
spaces but the latter resulted in a better separation of samples. Boskoop samples were perceived as more acid, astringent,
crispy and hard while the Cox variety was described as sweeter and more floury. Jonagold samples were perceived as juicier
and occupied an intermediate position, with the mealy Jonagold sample closer to the Cox samples. The agreement between sample
spaces showed that both panels perceived the major differences between samples in a similar way but the trained panel was
able to differentiate further, mainly between the texture characteristics.},

Free-choice profiling and subsequent generalised Procrustes analysis were therefore used for descriptive analysis of 8 whiskies by 100 consumers, to test the method under these conditions and to identify the dimensions used by consumers to discriminate between whiskies. The same whiskies were profiled by a trained panel using an agreed vocabulary. The consumer data showed that the panel could discriminate between the samples, and that the sample configuration could be interpreted in terms of the descriptors used by both panels and of the colour of the samples. Free-choice profiling was found to be a potentially useful method for consumer research, though difficulties were experienced in interpretation of the results.},

Overall the results confirmed the hypothesis, although further investigation into the semantic peculiarities of individual eating disorders is required.
